# Decision-Trees-and-Regression
Implementing Decision Trees and Regression from scratch. Decision Trees Question: There are multiple features... which feature do we split on? AND where do we split in this feature? - These questions were answered in the form of python functions in the assignment. Regression: This is a minimization problem (how well can we model the data while minimizing the error on the data set?). 

# Description
This is a Machine Learning homework assignment.
I cut out the questions not relevent for implementing a decision tree/regression.

# I really liked this project!
Coding a decision tree myself proves to me that I really know what is going on inside one. 
I am very proud of myself and I cannot wait to complete the other assignments that this class has to offer.
My grade on the assignment: 95/100
